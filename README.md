# Matrix Multiplication Program

This C++ program performs matrix multiplication using multiple threads. It utilizes the `<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<thread>`, `<mutex>`, `<stdexcept>`, `<fstream>`, and `<chrono>` standard libraries.

## Description

The program takes two matrices as input and multiplies them using threads to improve performance. It provides functions to multiply rows of matrices, multiply matrices using threads, and measure the execution time for different thread counts.

## Usage

To use this program:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable file.

## Features

- **Matrix Multiplication:** Multiplies two matrices efficiently using threads.
- **Thread Management:** Allows specifying the number of threads to use for matrix multiplication.
- **Execution Time Measurement:** Measures the execution time for matrix multiplication with different thread counts and outputs the results to a CSV file.
